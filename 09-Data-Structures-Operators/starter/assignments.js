/*
LECTURE: Values and Variables
1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console

let country = 'United States';
let continent = 'North America';
let population = 331; //Million

console.log(country, continent, population);
*/

/*
LECTURE: Data Types
1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
'language', but don't assign it any value yet
2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
to the console


let isIsland = false;
let language = '';

console.log(
  typeof isIsland,
  typeof population,
  typeof country,
  typeof language
);
*/

/*
LECTURE: let, const and var
1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens


language = 'English';
const country = 'United States';
const continent = 'North America';
const isIsland = false;
isIsland = true;
*/

/*
LECTURE: Basic Operators
1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
then how many people would live in each half?
2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than
Finland?
4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
have less people than the average country?
5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
people speak portuguese'

LECTURE: Strings and Template Literals
1. Recreate the 'description' variable from the last assignment, this time
using the template literal syntax
LECTURE: Taking Decisions: if / else Statements
1. If your country's population is greater that 33 million, log a string like this to the
console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. Otherwise, log a string like
'Portugal's population is 22 million below average' (the 22 is the average of 33
minus the country's population)
2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to
130. See the different results, and set the population back to original
LECTURE: Type Conversion and Coercion
1. Predict the result of these 5 operations without executing them:
'9' - '5';
'19' - '13' + '17';
'19' - '13' + 17;
'123' < 57;
5 + 6 + '4' + 9 - 4 - 2;
2. Execute the operations to check if you were right

/*
Your tasks:
1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner
to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above.
Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and
Data 2
5. Ignore draws this time
Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
Â§ Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
Hints:
Â§ To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
Â§ To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B.
Apply this to the team's average scores ðŸ˜‰


const koalaScore = [65, 54, 49];
const dolphinScore = [44, 23, 71];
const calcAverage = (a, b, c) => {
  return (a + b + c) / 3;
};

console.log(koalaScore);
console.log(calcAverage(65, 54, 49));
